I step off the edge




Out of remnant pages




with little reasons to aspiration

which I feel formerly about for
between the preambles



and could be inflected with reasons
Under the grass principle



and my heart rate
The long time I had a vision
You can hear it also through your leisure




2


as a pure product
for the duration of the answer



formerly a way
missing words
over the long line up in the sky
asynchronous
I continue to consume



full of potential




The days of parsing data


phrase them

3


I want to cite a poem so usual


Falling off the edge of the face
Under the past principle
of later pages
talking into pheasants bending themselves



Falling from this distance



I reuse unassimilable visions
It’s morning




And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies


And from a great distance



4


to the other end


love of breadth


tomorrow


like a shirt
The sun isn’t up
This is your voice
I continued to dream then




as pure as my children Walt Whitman
dawn already formerly nights
Under the grasp principle



5


Then blue and sun again a second, then night



I watch a moving afterimage




out from below the fold



washed by my memory

the prospects there already
In a continuous theme
to see the patterns on the birds


in not many tracks up in the sky



While I should be sleeping
I could consume the dream



6


I brought my qualities down




and not falling at all
talking into percents bending themselves




The ends of my transactions

And reached up the screen
I’m simply inside
My purpose up in the sky
where I need gravity


I’ll get there eventually
until I purpose up in the sky


7


I came back to me




In a vertiginous dream

I hear it between bills and stuff
walking from home along the measure
to be before the sun




where I sleep at times
aside from the retinas


in a sharp downward turn




into the stream of pictures
until my purpose up in the sky

8


That you can see only the back of



an impure product



I take it out in the snow fall
I am the first in the office




already formerly a long time
which as tracked befitted


aspirating visions
I captured an afterimage


until I purpose the horizon
off the edge of the world



9


by my memory
So I went back to sleep
Before anyone walks across the wide opening
such as I see



But my not feeling the memory aside
I have a memory between the day




Possessions people
Then fall then summer
that having been after content
Falling from my face

10


Who knows the way
in a continuous vertiginous dream
variegated reflected light
If I let myself see others desires



encoded off the end

I answered about


I put my bread down
out in the snow




to the ends


in that I cannot remember
