that agreed home



The world
in the fill space out front
Where I stand and relive

Under the last principle
I stay the right of my possessions

already formerly a long time



The prospect for careening healthily

as an impure product

an impure product

While I should be sleeping

I watch a movie



high up in the results




my possessions




and literally unproved




off the edge of the world




months




I came back to me

the other end transactions


I’ll pull myself another personality type

3


if I take a different measure
The sun high enough to enter directly
that having been after content
with her way to the ends




who know the ways to their other end
others desires
I end up in Bach
or the incoming stream
to be before the sun
Put in place as stationary destinations

4


I resume attributable visions
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff




Then I cannot see face value


I suspend live connections to you




off the end of the world




tomorrow
the resemblance




a precision for learning
Suspended live in connections to you



Or can have seen offering possession

I was advised to rewind
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i




in track as offer asked




There are quarterly goals
And make myself a visible

only with the latency
In short, this is an inconsistent book in the face of persuasion and manufactured desires. Also, it was written at the scale of minutes stretched across much distance and time.

decisions that can be attributable
Then I can’t presume to treat others
Right now I’m the cart

But my not feeling the memory inside



until my purpose up in the sky



The ventillation rushes on




executive breath

after having been contented
I swayed a little in my state



white spots on a black surface
who are so fresh and agile
conversation with our feelings

already formely a long time

Out of remnant pages
articles all around storming around
oddly grown over with historic bark
in that I cannot remember
an upsent afternoon


but it continued rippling muscle
before we can have a retroactive
there was no walking along


joined me in wasting my vision




we had inhabited actually

To the right of determined elections

One was up where it should be down
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
And as an extension of the values
I continue to subsume

by my memory




I could consume the dream




in the form filled offered trust




absence glut

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
is a function of the strength


by no ventillation my purpose




All that I own messageable



A baby and a bear

Then the sun isn’t up

out in the snow
Then the sun isn’t available
I reuse unassimilable visions
which as tracked befitted



10


I let myself treat


Falling from this distance

To neither study



The dogs and lillies
But not to me directly

So I am told by the ventillation
full of the missing words
my possession of my children



Under the grasp principle



I’ll get there eventually
